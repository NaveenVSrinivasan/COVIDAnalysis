17 years after the SARS-CoV epidemic, the world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, our best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural analyses reveal that the core -1 PRF signal, composed of the U UUA AAC slippery site and three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot is highly conserved. In contrast, the upstream attenuator hairpin is less well conserved. Functional assays revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery site strongly ablate -1 PRF activity. We suggest that molecules that were previously identified as inhibiting SARS-CoV mediated -1 PRF may serve as lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.	-19.084728240966797	23.620166778564453
20 E-probe Diagnostic for Nucleic acid Analysis (EDNA) is a bioinformatic tool originally 21 developed to detect plant pathogens in metagenomic databases. However, 22 enhancements made to EDNA increased its capacity to conduct hypothesis directed 23 detection of specific gene targets present in transcriptomic databases. To target specific 24 pathogenicity factors used by the pathogen to infect its host or other targets of interest, 25 e-probes need to be developed for transcripts related to that function. In this study, 26 EDNA transcriptomics (EDNAtran) was developed to detect the expression of genes 27 related to aflatoxin production at the transcriptomic level. E-probes were designed from 28 genes up-regulated during A. flavus aflatoxin production. EDNAtran detected gene 29 transcripts related to aflatoxin production in a transcriptomic database from corn, where 30 aflatoxin was produced. The results were significantly different from e-probes being 31 used in the transcriptomic database where aflatoxin was not produced (atoxigenic AF36 32 strain and toxigenic AF70 in Potato Dextrose Broth). 33 34 Maize [1], peanuts [2], tree nuts, dried spices [3] and cottonseed [4] are crops that can 35 be infected during the pre-harvest, post-harvest and/or storage period with Aspergillus 36 flavus Link. This fungus produces polyketide secondary metabolites named aflatoxins.	2.6965298652648926	20.40399932861328
24 A subset of intracellular mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases diphtheria toxin-like (ARTDs, aka 25 mono-PARPs) is induced by type I interferons. Some of these mono-ARTDs feature antiviral 26 activity while certain RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), encode mono-ADP-27 ribosylhydrolases, suggesting a role for mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) in host-virus 28 conflicts. CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a 29 macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. 30 This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in 31 replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection 32 are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication 33 and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified 34 ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-35 dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein 36 nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a 37 functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction 38 of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a 39 decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This 40 suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a 41 hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We 42 hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found 43 that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing 44 polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized 45 by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic 46 explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV. 47 Author Summary 48 Infectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever 49 new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased 50 human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause 51 world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic 52 rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs 53 are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic 54 function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-55 ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this 56 modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because 57 macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets. 58 59 Introduction 60 Upon viral infection host cells initiate an antiviral immune response. Because the regulation 61 of protein function through post-translational modifications (PTMs) is among the quickest 62 mechanisms to adapt to challenges such as viral infections, PTMs display an essential part of 63 antiviral signaling. Viruses have developed multifaceted strategies to evade or even hijack 64 cellular mechanisms, e.g. encoding proteins that regulate PTMs and thereby counteract the 65 antiviral reaction of the host [1-5]. Recent findings have elaborated on the role of intracellular 66 ADP-ribosylation at the host-pathogen interface [6-12]. ADP-ribosylation is an ancient PTM of 67 proteins and intracellularly mainly catalyzed by members of the ADP-ribosyltransferase 68 diphtheria toxin-like (ARTD) family (also known as poly-ADP-ribosylpolymerases (PARPs)), 69 which is composed of seventeen proteins [1, 13]. These enzymes use NAD + as co-factor to 70 transfer ADP-ribose onto a substrate protein with release of nicotinamide. Based on their 71 . : bioRxiv preprint 4 catalytic features the ARTDs are subdivided into three classes. The first class contains ARTD1, 72 2, 5, and 6, which are capable of transferring multiple ADP-ribose moieties in an iterative 73 process and thereby forming long polymers. This results in poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) 74 of substrate proteins. The second and largest class is defined by members that are restricted 75 to mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) (ARTD3, 4,(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(14)(15)(16)(17), whereas the third 76 group is defined by ARTD13, which lacks the ability to bind NAD + and thus is catalytically 77 inactive [18]. 78 79 PARylation, arguably best known for its function in DNA damage response, has also been 80 linked to chromatin organization, ribosome biogenesis, telomere maintenance, signaling 81 processes and cell death [1, 19, 20]. In contrast functions of MARylation are less well 82 understood but expanding with links to DNA damage repair, gene expression, signaling, stress 83 response and cell death [1, 21]. Recent findings indicate a role for MARylation in host-84 pathogen conflicts [1, 21, 22]. The expression of several mono-ARTDs is triggered by type I 85 interferons (IFNs) or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), like LPS, as part of an 86 innate immune response to pathogens [6, 8, 11,[23][24][25]. Among these mono-ARTDs are ARTD7, 87 ARTD10 and ARTD12, which have been identified to mediate clearance of Venezuelan Equine 88 Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) by interfering with viral replication [7, 8]. In line with this, Zika virus 89 replication is restricted by ARTD12 [26] . In addition to these molecular and cell-based studies, 90 evolutionary analysis suggests a role for several ARTD family members at the host-pathogen 91 interface, among them the macrodomain containing ARTDs (ARTD7-9) and ARTD13 [27]. 92 Although catalytically inactive, the latter is best studied for being restrictive for viral 93 replication by recognizing foreign CG-rich RNA through its Zinc finger domains [28, 29]. 94 95 .

A new porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV was recently identified from suckling piglets 20 with severe diarrhea in southern China and its genome sequence is most identical (~95% 21 identity) to that of bat α-coronavirus HKU2. It again indicates bats are the natural 22 reservoir of many coronaviruses that have great potential for cross-species transmission 23 to animals and humans by recombination and/or mutation. Here we report the cryo-EM 24 structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 Å and 2.83 Å 25 resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural 26 similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 27 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically 28 analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and 29 the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-coronavirus spikes. The 30 results show that the NTD and CTD of HKU2/SADS-CoV are probably the most 31 ancestral in the evolution of spike. Although the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion 32 is highly conserved, the connecting region after fusion peptide in HKU2/SADS-CoV 33 S2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses. These results 34 structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between HKU2 /SADS-CoV 35 and β-coronavirus spikes and provide new insights into the evolution and cross-species 36 transmission of coronaviruses. : bioRxiv preprint 39 Coronaviruses, categorized into the order Nidovirales family Coronaviridae and 40 subfamily Coronavirinae, are a large group of viral pathogens with a wide host range 1 . 41 Their infections in humans, other mammals and birds can cause respiratory, hepatic, 42 enteric and neurological diseases with varying severity 2 . The severe acute respiratory 43 syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 44 (MERS-CoV) have posed severe threats to human health in the 21 st century 1,3 . In the 45 meantime, coronaviruses infecting domestic animals also bring substantial economic 46 losses 4 . For example, the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) 47 (also known as SeACoV and PEAV) isolated in 2017 caused outbreaks of severe watery 48 diarrhea of suckling piglets with a mortality up to 90% in several commercial pig farms 49 in Guangdong Province of China 5-10 . SADS-CoV is an α-coronavirus and other 50 representative members in the α-genus are porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 51 (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), porcine respiratory 52 coronavirus (PRCV), human NL63 and 229E coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-53 229E) 1 . Representative members in other three genera include mouse hepatitis 54 coronavirus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-55 OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the β-genus, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in the 56 γ-genus and porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCoV) in the δ-genus 1 . 57 Cross-species transmission promoted by genetic recombination and/or mutations 58 underlies the host range expansion of coronaviruses 3,11-13 . Bats are the natural reservoir 59 of more than 30 different α-and β-coronaviruses that have great potential for 60 interspecies transmission by recombination and/or mutation 12,14-16 . Data on genetic 61 evolution, receptor binding and pathogenesis have demonstrated that human SARS-62 CoV and MERS-CoV most likely originate from bats 1 . Palm civets and dromedary 63 camels are the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV from bats to humans 1 , 64 respectively. The newly identified porcine SADS-CoV isolates are also found to share 65 ~95% sequence identity with Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2, and this further 66 stressed the severe results of coronavirus spillover from bats to domestic animals 5-10 .	-10.762981414794922	15.897148132324219
A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 80,000 confirmed infections and 2,700 fatalities (as of Feb 27, 2020). Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.	4.839105129241943	-28.28717041015625
A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged as a global threat. As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number R 0 -the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of R 0 vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of R 0 across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate r, the mean generation intervalḠ, and the generation-interval dispersion κ. We then apply our framework to early estimates of R 0 for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early R 0 estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of R 0 , including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate R 0 at the outset of an epidemic.	26.158187866210938	-14.384456634521484
A pattern in which nucleotide transitions are favored several-fold over transversions is common in molecular evolution. When this pattern occurs among amino acid replacements, explanations often invoke an effect of selection, on the grounds that transitions are more conservative in their effects on proteins. However, the underlying hypothesis of conservative transitions has never been tested directly. Here we assess support for this hypothesis using direct evidence: the fitness effects of mutations in actual proteins, measured via individual or paired growth experiments. We assembled data from 8 published studies, ranging in size from 24 to 757 single-nucleotide mutations that change an amino acid. Every study has the statistical power to reveal significant effects of amino acid exchangeability, and most studies have the power to discern a binary conservative-vs-radical distinction. However, only one study suggests that transitions are significantly more conservative than transversions. In the combined set of 1239 replacements, the chance that a transition is more conservative than a transversion is 53 % (95 % confidence interval, 50 % to 56 %), compared to the null expectation of 50 %. We show that this effect is not large compared to that of most biochemical factors, and is not large enough to explain the several-fold bias observed in evolution. In short, available data have the power to verify the "conservative transitions" hypothesis if true, but suggest instead that selection on proteins plays at best a minor role in the observed bias.

ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling proteins represent a diverse family of proteins that share ATPase domains that are adapted to regulate protein-DNA interactions. Here we present structures of the yeast Chd1 protein engaged with nucleosomes in the presence of the transition state mimic ADP-beryllium fluoride. The path of DNA strands through the ATPase domains indicates the presence of contacts conserved with single strand translocases and additional contacts with both strands that are unique to Snf2 related proteins. The structure provides connectivity between rearrangement of ATPase lobes to a closed, nucleotide bound state and the sensing of linker DNA. Two turns of linker DNA are prised off the surface of the histone octamer as a result of Chd1 binding, and both the histone H3 tail and ubiquitin conjugated to lysine 120 are re-orientated towards the unravelled DNA. This indicates how changes to nucleosome structure can alter the way in which histone epitopes are presented.	-18.292421340942383	38.48904800415039
Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5′ UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5′ terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2′ hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function. Deletion experiments showed that although PKs are not essential 38 for replication, they provide genomes with a competitive advantage. However, although 39 replicons and full-length genomes lacking all PKs were replication competent, no infectious 40 virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one PK copy. This is consistent with our 41 earlier report describing the presence of putative packaging signals in the PK region.	-14.574115753173828	31.125181198120117
Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected cases plays a crucial role in timely quarantine and medical treatment. Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning-based software system was developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weaklysupervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and highperformance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. The developed deep learning software is available at https://github.com/sydney0zq/covid-19-detection.	21.1043758392334	-1.9293272495269775
Advanced biomaterials provide versatile ways to spatially and temporally control immune cell activity, potentially enhancing their therapeutic potency and safety. Precise cell modulation demands multi-modal display of functional proteins with controlled densities on biomaterials. Here, we develop an artificial immune cell engager (AICE) platform -biodegradable particles onto which multiple proteins are densely loaded with ratiometric control via short nucleic acid tethers. We demonstrate the impact of AICE with varying ratios of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies on ex vivo expansion of human primary T cells. We also show that AICE can be used to control the activity of engineered T cells in vivo. AICE injected intratumorally can provide a local priming signal for systemically administered AND-gate chimeric antigen receptor T cells, driving local tumor clearance while sparing uninjected tumors that model potentially cross-reactive healthy tissues. This modularly functionalized biomaterial thus provides a flexible platform to achieve sophisticated control over cell-based immunotherapies. Functionalized biomaterials can work synergistically with natural or engineered immune cells for cancer immunotherapy 1-15 . Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) engineered T cells has shown success and clinical approval for the treatment of B cell cancers 16 . However, for CAR T cells to fulfill their promising potential, particularly for targeting solid tumors 17, 18 , important challenges must be overcome to improve both efficacy 17-20 and safety 21-24 .

An epidemic can be characterized by its speed (i.e., the exponential growth rate r) and strength (i.e., the reproductive number R). Disease modelers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for this classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a corresponding speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like R = 1, and show that we can measure the speed and strength of an intervention on the same scale as the speed and strength of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, just as the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of "test-and-treat" interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We suggest that disease modelers should avoid over-emphasizing the reproductive number at the expense of the exponential growth rate, but instead look at these as complementary measures.	32.076045989990234	-10.44556999206543
An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named CoVID-19, was first reported in China on 31 December 2019. As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for health-care capacity planning.	9.58193302154541	-28.832881927490234
An outbreak of new SARS-like viral in Wuhan, China has been named 2019-nCoV. The current state of the epidemic is increasingly serious, and there has been the urgent necessity to develop an effective new drug. In previous studies, it was found that the conformation change in CTD1 was the region where SARS-CoV bound to human ACE2. Although there are mutations of the 2019-nCoV, the binding energy of ACE2 remains high. The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes. Furthermore, site prediction on the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV suggests some core amino acid area may be a novel drug target against 2019-nCoV.	-30.85123634338379	12.684643745422363

As the predominant etiological agent of the common cold, human rhinovirus (HRV) is 19 the leading cause of human infectious disease. Early studies showed monovalent formalin-20 inactivated HRV vaccine can be protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) correlated 21 with protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further vaccine 22 efforts. We approached this problem straightforwardly. We tested the hypothesis that increasing 23 virus input titers in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine will result in broad nAb responses. Here, 24 we show that serum nAb against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent, 25 inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel (alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice 26 and 50-valent in rhesus macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient 27 quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the 28 response. We for the first time generated a vaccine capable of inducing nAb responses to 29 numerous and diverse HRV types. 30 31 38	-8.167176246643066	6.39917516708374

Background: As of March 2, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 80174 people and caused 2915 deaths in China. This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42·9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner.

Background: The current outbreak caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has become a worldwide concern. As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected. We downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs. Results: An isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1·05 × 10 -2 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.	22.175928115844727	7.310736656188965
Background: To explore the cellular immunity and cytokines status of NCP patients and to predict 36 the correlation between the cellular immunity levels, cytokines and the severity of patients. 37 Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was 38 collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on 39 the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups 40 were analyzed. 41 Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two 42 groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%, 43 respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK 44 cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild 45 group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than 46 severe group; There was no significant linear correlation between the lymphocyte subsets and 47 cytokines, while significant differences were noticed between the two groups in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, 48 IL-6 and IL-10. 49 Conclusions: Low levels of CD4+T and CD8+T are common in severe NCP. IL-6 and IL-10 levels 50 were higher in severe patients. T cell subsets and cytokines can be used as one of the basis for 51 predicting the transition from mild to severe. Large number of samples are still needed to confirm 52 the "warning value" of CD4 + T, CD8 + T IL-6 and IL-10.	-37.16929244995117	-26.278993606567383
Based on publicly released data for 1212 patients, we investigated the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan of China. The following findings are obtained: 1) COVID-19 patients in Henan show gender (55% vs 45%) and age (81% aged between 21 and 60) preferences, possible causes were explored; 2) Statistical analysis on 483 patients reveals that the estimated average, mode and median incubation periods are 7.4, 4 and 7 days; Incubation periods of 92% patients were no more than 14 days; 3) The epidemic of COVID-19 in Henan has undergone three stages and showed high correlations with the numbers of patients that recently return from Wuhan; 4) Network analysis on the aggregate outbreak phenomena of COVID-19 revealed that 208 cases were clustering infected, and various people's Hospital are the main force in treating patients. The related investigations have potential implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19.	-7.962397575378418	-42.06095886230469

Bayesian inference methods for individual-level geo-located epidemiological data have enabled reconstruction of transmission trees and quantification of disease spread in space and time, while accounting for uncertainty in missing data. However, these methods have rarely been applied to endemic diseases or ones in which asymptomatic infection plays a role, for which novel estimation methods are required. Here, we develop such methods to analyse longitudinal incidence data on visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, postkala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic community in Bangladesh. Incorporating recent data on infectiousness of VL and PKDL, we show that while VL cases drive transmission when incidence is high, the contribution of PKDL increases significantly as VL incidence declines (reaching 55% in this setting). Transmission is highly focal: >85% of mean distances from inferred infectors to their secondary VL cases were <300m, and estimated average times from infector onset to secondary case infection were <4 months for 90% of VL infectors, but up to 2.75yrs for PKDL infectors. Estimated numbers of secondary VL cases per VL and PKDL case varied from 0-6 and were strongly correlated with the infector's duration of symptoms. Counterfactual simulations suggest that prevention of PKDL could have reduced VL incidence by up to a quarter. These results highlight the need for prompt detection and treatment of PKDL to achieve VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent and provide quantitative estimates to guide spatiotemporally-targeted interventions against VL. visceral leishmaniasis | post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis | spatiotemporal transmission | transmission tree | Bayesian inference S patiotemporal heterogeneity in incidence is a hallmark of 1 infectious diseases. Insight into this heterogeneity has in-2 creased considerably in recent years due to greater availability 3 of geo-located individual-level epidemiological data and the 4 development of sophisticated statistical inference methods for 5 partially observed transmission processes (1-6). These meth-6 ods have been developed for epidemics, in which the immune 7 status of the population is known, and for diseases with a 8 short time course that are relatively easily diagnosed, such 9 as measles, influenza, and foot-and-mouth disease (3, 4, 7). Here, we extend these methods to a slowly progressing endemic 11 disease of humans in which asymptomatic infection plays an 12 important role. 13 We analyse detailed longitudinal individual-level data on 14 incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, post-15 kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic 16 community in Fulbaria, Bangladesh (8). VL, also known as 17 kala-azar, is a lethal sandfly-borne parasitic disease targeted 18 for elimination as a public health problem (<1 case/10,000 19 people/year at subdistrict/district level depending on the 20 country) in the Indian subcontinent (ISC) by 2020 (9). PKDL 21 is a non-lethal skin condition that occurs after treatment 22 for VL in 5-20% of cases in the ISC, and less frequently in 23 individuals who report no history of prior VL (8, 10). It is 24 characterised by skin lesions of di ering severity and parasite 25 load, ranging from macules and papules (least severe, lowest 26 load) to nodules (most severe, highest load) (11). We estimate 27 the relative contributions of di erent disease states (VL, PKDL 28 and asymptomatic infection) to transmission, and quantify the 29 rate of spread of infection around infected individuals in space 30 and time by reconstructing transmission trees. Our analysis 31 provides insight into the spatiotemporal spread of visceral 32 leishmaniasis as well as quantitative estimates that can guide 33 the targeting of interventions, such as active case detection 34 and indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide, around VL 35 Although methods for analysing individual-level geo-located disease data have existed for some time, they have rarely been used to analyse endemic human diseases. Here we apply such methods to nearly a decade's worth of uniquely detailed epidemiological data on incidence of the deadly vector-borne disease visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and its secondary condition, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), to quantify the spread of infection around cases in space and time by inferring who infected whom, and estimate the relative contribution of different infection states to transmission. Our findings highlight the key role long diagnosis delays and PKDL play in maintaining VL transmission. This detailed characterisation of the spatiotemporal transmission of VL will help inform targeting of interventions around VL and PKDL cases. : medRxiv preprint 131 sion (over and above that from being at zero distance from 132 an infectious individual) and with di erent pre-symptomatic 133 and asymptomatic relative infectiousness.

Before the lock-down of Wuhan/Hubei/China, on January 23 rd 2020, a large number of individuals infected by COVID-19 moved from the epicenter Wuhan and the Hubei province due to the Spring Festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the Shaanxi province. The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xi'an. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of "resumption of work", show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10 th and February 4 th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.	10.273408889770508	-35.247432708740234
COVID-19 has caused a major epidemic worldwide, however, much is yet to be known 39 about the epidemiology and evolution of the virus. One reason is that the challenges 40 underneath sequencing HCoV-19 directly from clinical samples have not been com-41 pletely tackled. Here we illustrate the application of amplicon and hybrid capture (cap-42 ture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) 43 sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual var-44 iations of HCoV-19 from clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral 45 load.

COVID-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the United States, including school closures. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. We account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient's COVID-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%. School closures come with many tradeoffs. Setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce COVID-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. Detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools.

COVID-19, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID-19 severity. This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5 th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID-19 infection or ICU admission. Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID-19 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 -7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28-10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICUadmitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2. 44 -16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 -48.2).

Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 -7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 -5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity. Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID-19.	-22.823759078979492	-22.323558807373047

China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged >60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p<0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.	-23.7753849029541	-27.917560577392578
Clinical assessment of possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19 respiratory illness, has been a major activity of infectious diseases services in the UK and elsewhere since the first report of cases in December 2019. We report our case series of 68 patients, reviewed by Infectious Diseases Consultants at a Regional Infectious Diseases Unit in the UK. We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29 th Jan 2020 and 24 th Feb 2020. Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment. A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted to a negative pressure room of whom 5/68 were admitted solely due to an inability to isolate at home. Patients requiring either admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were similar to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials, with modestly more fever and shortness of breath in the clinically admitted / antimicrobial group. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were doxycycline, moxifloxacin and oseltamivir. The majority of patients had mild illness which did not require a clinical intervention to manage. This finding supports a community testing approach supported by clinicians to review the proportion of more unwell patients.	-16.38579750061035	-23.9421443939209
Compound heterozygotes occur when different mutations at the same locus on both maternal and paternal chromosomes produce a recessive trait. Here we present the tool VarCount for the quantification of mutations at the individual level. We used VarCount to characterize compound heterozygous coding variants in patients with epileptic encephalopathy and in the 1000 genomes participants. The Epi4k data contains variants identified by whole exome sequencing in patients with either Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) or Infantile Spasms (IS), as well as their parents. We queried the Epi4k dataset (264 trios) and the phased 1000 genomes data (2504 participants) for recessive variants. To assess enrichment, transcript counts were compared between the Epi4k and 1000 genomes participants using minor allele frequency (MAF) cutoffs of 0.5% and 1.0%, and including all ancestries or only probands of European ancestry. In the Epi4k participants, we found enrichment for rare, compound heterozygous mutations in six genes, including three involved in neuronal growth and development -PRTG (p=0.00086, 1% MAF, combined ancestries), TNC (p=0.0221% MAF, combined ancestries), and MACF1 (p=0.0245, 0.5% MAF, EU ancestry). Due the total number of transcripts considered in these analyses, the enrichment detected was not significant after correction for multiple testing and higher powered or prospective studies are necessary to validate the candidacy of these genes. However, PRTG, TNC, and MACF1 are potential novel recessive epilepsy genes and our results highlight that compound heterozygous mutations should be considered in sporadic epilepsy.	30.986217498779297	9.627832412719727
Confirmed infection cases in mainland China were analyzed using the data up to January 28, 2020 (first 13 days of reliable confirmed cases). For the first period the cumulative number of cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward deviation from the exponential growth. This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. As data become available, we subsequently analyzed them during three consecutive periods obtaining a sequence of model predictions. All available data up were processed the same way. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data. Using this model and the three sets of data, we estimated maximum cases as about 21,000, 28,000 and 35,000 cases refining these predictions in near-real time. With slightly different approach (linearization in time) the estimate of maximum cases was even higher (about 65,000). Although the estimates of maximum cases increase as more data were reported all models show reaching a peak in mid-February in contrast to the unconfined exponential growth. These predictions do not account for any possible other secondary sources of infection.	28.440427780151367	-21.79730796813965
Currently, a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV causes an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Little is known about its epidemiological characteristics. Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 (5.6 -7.7, 95% CI) days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5 th to 97.5 th percentile). These values help to inform case definitions for 2019-nCoV and appropriate durations for quarantine.	12.904805183410645	-45.0556755065918
Estimation of the fraction and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease. Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection. Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020). Per person, these undocumented .

Faced with the current large-scale public health emergency, collecting, sorting, and analyzing biomedical information related to the "coronavirus" should be done as quickly as possible to gain a global perspective, which is a basic requirement for strengthening epidemic control capacity. However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information.

For decades, cationic polymer nanoparticles have been investigated for nucleic acid delivery. Despite promising in vitro transfection results, most formulations have failed to translate into the clinic due to significant in vivo toxicity -especially when delivered intravenously. To address this significant problem, we investigated the detailed mechanisms that govern the complex in vivo systemic toxicity response to common polymeric nanoparticles. We determined that the toxicity response is material dependent. For branched polyethylenimine (bPEI) nanoparticles -toxicity is a function of multiple pathophysiological responses -triggering of innate immune sensors, induction of hepatic toxicity, and significant alteration of hematological properties. In contrast, for chitosan-based nanoparticles -systemic toxicity is primarily driven through innate immune activation. We further identified that modification of primary amines to secondary and tertiary amines using the small molecule imidazole-aceticacid (IAA) ameliorates in vivo toxicity from both nanocarriers by different, material-specific mechanisms related to Toll-like receptor 4 activation (for bPEI) and complement activation driven neutrophil infiltration (for chitosan), respectively. Our results provide a detailed roadmap for evaluating in vivo toxicity of nanocarriers and identifies potential opportunities to reduce toxicity for eventual clinical translation.	-6.149476051330566	56.81956481933594
Genome Detective is a web-based, user-friendly software application to quickly and accurately assemble all known virus genomes from next generation sequencing datasets. This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for 2019-nCoV. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.	4.660755157470703	2.601701021194458
Honey bees are eusocial insects, living in a colony that is often described as a superorganism. RNA mobility among cells of an organism has been documented in plants and animals. Here we show that RNA spreads further in honey bees, and is horizontally transferred between individuals and across generations. We found that honey bees share biologically active RNA through secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jellies. Such RNA initiates RNA interference, which is a known defense mechanism against viral infection. Furthermore, we characterized diverse RNA profiles of worker and royal jelly, including fragmented viral RNA. Our findings demonstrate a transmissible RNA pathway with potential roles in social immunity and epigenetic signaling among members of the hive. One of the characteristics of RNA interference (RNAi) is systemic spread of the silencing signal among cells and tissues throughout the organism. Systemic RNAi, initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ingestion, has been reported in diverse invertebrates, including honey bees, demonstrating environmental RNA uptake that undermines homologous gene expression. However, the question why any organism would take up RNA from the environment has remained largely unanswered. Here, we report on horizontal RNA flow among honey bees mediated by secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jelly diets. We show that ingested dsRNA spreads through the bee's hemolymph associated with a protein complex. The systemic dsRNA is secreted with the jelly and delivered to larvae via ingestion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that transmission of jelly-secreted dsRNA to larvae is biologically active and triggers gene knockdown that lasts into adulthood. Finally, RNA extracted from worker and royal jellies harbor differential naturally occurring RNA populations. Some of these RNAs corresponded to honey bee protein coding genes, transposable elements, non-coding RNA as well as bacteria, fungi and viruses. These results reveal an inherent property of honey bees to share RNA among individuals and generations. Thus, our findings suggest a transmissible RNA pathway, playing a role in social immunity and epigenetic signaling between honey bees and potentially among other closely interacting organisms.	-6.37843132019043	42.995567321777344
In 2013, U.S. swine producers were confronted with the disruptive emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED). Movement of animals among farms is hypothesised to have played a role in the spread of PED among farms. Via this or other mechanisms, the rate of spread may also depend on the geographic density of farms and climate. To evaluate such effects on a large scale, we analyse state-level counts of outbreaks with variables describing the distribution of farm sizes and types, aggregate flows of animals among farms, and an index of climate. Our first main finding is that it is possible for a correlation analysis to be sensitive to transmission model parameters. This finding is based on a global sensitivity analysis of correlations on simulated data that included a biased and noisy observation model based on the available PED data. Our second main finding is that flows are significantly associated with the reports of PED outbreaks. This finding is based on correlations of pairwise relationships and regression modeling of total and weekly outbreak counts. These findings illustrate how variation in population structure may be employed along with observational data to improve understanding of disease spread. together produce 95 percent of the U.S. pig crop. 5 Farms experiencing outbreaks have suffered 90 percent and higher losses of .

In our increasingly interconnected world, it is crucial to understand the risk of an outbreak originating in one country or region and spreading to the rest of the world. Digital disease surveillance tools such as ProMED and HealthMap have the potential to serve as important early warning systems as well as complement the field surveillance during an ongoing outbreak. Here we present a flexible statistical model that uses data produced from digital surveillance tools (ProMED and HealthMap) to forecast short term incidence trends in a spatially explicit manner. The model was applied to data collected by ProMED and HealthMap during the 2013-2016 West African Ebola epidemic. The model was able to predict each instance of international spread 1 to 4 weeks in advance. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of using publicly available digital surveillance data for assessing outbreak dynamics in real-time.	14.303898811340332	-14.299917221069336
In the note, the logistic growth regression model is used for the estimation of the final size and its peak time of the coronavirus epidemic in China, South Korea, and the rest of the World. In the previous article [1], we try to estimate the final size of the epidemic for the whole World using the logistic model and SIR model. The estimation was about 83000 cases. Both models show that the outbreak is moderating; however, new data showed a linear upward trend. It turns out that the epidemy in China was slowing but is begin to spread elsewhere in the World. In this note, we will give forecasting epidemic size for China, South Korea, and the rest of the World and daily predictions using the logistic model.

However, the logistic model is given by explicit formula and is thus much simpler for regression analysis than the SIR model, where one must on each optimization step solve a system of ordinary differential equations.

In the wake of the Rohingya population's mass migration from Myanmar, one of the world's largest 10 refugee settlements was constructed in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh to accommodate nearly 900,000 new 11 refugees. Refugee populations are particularly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks due to many 12 population and environmental factors. A large measles outbreak, with over 2,500 cases, occurred among 13 the Rohingya population between September and December 2017. Here, we estimate key epidemiological 14 parameters and use a dynamic mathematical model of measles transmission to evaluate the effectiveness 15 of the reactive vaccination campaigns in the refugee camps. We also estimate the potential for subsequent 16 outbreaks under different vaccination coverage scenarios. Our modeling results highlight the success of 17 the vaccination campaigns in rapidly curbing transmission and emphasize the public health importance 18 of maintaining high levels of vaccination in this population, where high birth rates and historically low 19 vaccination coverage rates create suitable conditions for future measles outbreaks.	12.23440170288086	-23.744569778442383
In this paper, we estimate the reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 based on Wallinga and Lipsitch framework [11] and a novel statistical time delay dynamic system. We use the observed data reported in CCDC's paper to estimate distribution of the generation interval of the infection and apply the simulation results from the time delay dynamic system as well as released data from CCDC to fit the growth rate. The conclusion is: Based our Fudan-CCDC model, the growth rate r of COVID-19 is almost in [0.30, 0.32] which is larger than the growth rate 0.1 estimated by CCDC [9], and the reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 is estimated by 3.25 ≤ R 0 ≤ 3.4 if we simply use R = 1 + r * T c with T c = 7.5, which is bigger than that of SARS. Some evolutions and predictions are listed.	-9.436586380004883	-17.081287384033203
In this study, we reported for the first time the existence of complemented palindrome small RNAs 26 (cpsRNAs) and proposed cpsRNAs and palindrome small RNAs (psRNAs) as a novel class of small RNAs. 27 The first discovered cpsRNA UCUUUAACAAGCUUGUUAAAGA from SARS coronavirus named SARS-28 CoV-cpsR-22 contained 22 nucleotides perfectly matching its reverse complementary sequence. Further 29 sequence analysis supported that SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 originated from bat betacoronavirus. The results of 30 RNAi experiments showed that one 19-nt segment of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 significantly induced cell 31 apoptosis. These results suggested that SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 could play a role in SARS-CoV infection or 32 pathogenicity. The discovery of psRNAs and cpsRNAs paved the way to find new markers for pathogen 33 detection and reveal the mechanisms in the infection or pathogenicity from a different point of view. The 34 discovery of psRNAs and cpsRNAs also broaden the understanding of palindrome motifs in animal of plant 35 genomes.	-23.201126098632812	16.993288040161133
Influenza is a major global public health threat as a result of its highly pathogenic variants, large 27 zoonotic reservoir, and pandemic potential. Metagenomic viral sequencing offers the potential of 28 a diagnostic test for influenza which also provides insights on transmission, evolution and drug 29 resistance, and simultaneously detects other viruses. We therefore set out to apply Oxford 30 Nanopore Technology to metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples. We generated 31 influenza reads down to a limit of detection of 10 2 -10 3 genome copies/ml in pooled samples, 32 observing a strong relationship between the viral titre and the proportion of influenza reads (p = 33 4.7x10 -5 ). Applying our methods to clinical throat swabs, we generated influenza reads for 27/27 34 samples with high-to-mid viral titres (Cycle threshold (Ct) values <30) and 6/13 samples with low 35 viral titres (Ct values 30-40). No false positive reads were generated from 10 influenza-negative 36 samples. Thus Nanopore sequencing operated with 83% sensitivity (95% CI 67-93%) and 100% 37 specificity (95% CI 69-100%) compared to the current diagnostic standard. Coverage of full 38 length virus was dependent on sample composition, being negatively influenced by increased 39 host and bacterial reads. However, at high influenza titres, we were able to reconstruct >99% 40 complete sequence for all eight gene segments. We also detected Human Coronavirus and 41 generated a near complete Human Metapneumovirus genome from clinical samples. While 42 further optimisation is required to improve sensitivity, this approach shows promise for the 43 Nanopore platform to be used in the diagnosis and genetic analysis of influenza and other 44 respiratory viruses. 45 46	3.2708256244659424	10.441896438598633
It . https://doi.org/10.1101/328674 doi: bioRxiv preprint 59 Globally, it is estimated that a minimum 30-40% of the crop cultivated gets destroyed 60 annually due to pests and diseases [4]. In India, bacterial blight alone reduces the yield between 61 60 to 80 percent above global yield loss in pomegranate. To avoid yield loss, it is very important 62 and necessary to develop an efficiently sensitive pathogen detection method within incubation time 63 of the pathogen (i.e. time between the host infection and expression of the disease symptoms) 64 [5,6]. 65 The most common methods employed for detecting the plant pathogens include 66 immunological techniques like ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) [7] and molecular 67 methods such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) [8] and Southern blotting [9]. The methods for 68 early detection of the plant pathogens in the field has to be designed in such a way that it has to be 69 competently very sensitive, specific, cost-effective and detectable with a minimal equipment 70 facilities [10]. For instance, the PCR based technique has its own drawbacks which require high 71 quality and quantity of DNA and amplification is complex that requires a thermal cycler for 72 changing the reaction temperature and requires relatively long time for the amplification process 73 to complete. Further, it also requires agarose gel electrophoresis and gel documentation to confirm 74 the amplification [11]. To overcome these limitations, researchers have shown interest in 75 developing an isothermal amplification technique termed as Loop-mediated isothermal 76 amplification (LAMP) [12]. LAMP is an auto-cycling strand displacement DNA synthesis 77 technique, which is carried out at a constant temperature and does not require a thermal-cycler. 78 The amplification is completed within 30-60 minutes at a constant temperature of 60-65º C, which 79 can be carried out in a simple water bath or heating block [13]. Moreover, LAMP is a cost effective 80 and it does not require a thermal cycler and electrophoretic unit, as the result can be inferred as 81 positive or negative with the colour change or turbidity observed by naked eye without spending 82 much time [14]. 83 The favorable target for bacterial pathogen diagnostic includes mainly, 16S ribosomal 84 RNA (rRNA) gene which is been widely used to identify the bacterial species among different 85 bacteria [15-17]. This diversity is unique for species and their sequences are presented inside their 86 nine (V1 -V9) hypervariable regions which constitutes useful targets [18]. These regions are 87 highly conserved stretches in bacteria, which facilitates the identification through PCR In principle, the LAMP assay recognizes six specifically designed primers that recognize 90 eight distinct sequences from the target bacterial DNA [20]. It consists of two outer primers (F3 91 and B3), two inner primers (FIP and BIP), a loop-forward (LF) and a loop-backward (LB). These 92 six primers ensure a high specificity for target DNA amplification. Moreover, these primers enable 93 generation of a stem-loop DNA for subsequent complex LAMP amplification, which includes self-94 priming reaction. A mixture of DNA, differing in the number of loops and length of the stem-loop 95 is produced as a final product [21]. By considering the advantages of LAMP assay, which is widely 96 used to detect broad range of microorganisms[22,23]. The present study was aimed to detect the 97 bacterial blight of pomegranate in early stages with minimum pathogen DNA template by 98 optimizing several DNA intercalating dyes with lower temperature in a shorter time with less 99 technical skills. 100 MATERIALS AND METHODS Source of bacterial blight material used for the study 102 Ten Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae (Xap) isolates collected from four different regions of 103 Karnataka, India were used in this study (Fig 1) . Additionally, we have also isolated 29 non-104 Xanthomonas bacteria from pomegranate Table 1 . The pure culture Xap isolates were maintained 105 in a Nutrient Broth for 72 hours and the DNA was extracted using crude method. The quality and 106 quantity of the DNA were determined using Nanodrop (Model -DS-11 FX +, DeNovix, USA).	8.66877269744873	20.257240295410156

Latent HSV-1 is occasionally reactivated causing peripheral pathology and under certain circumstances it can migrate into the central nervous system causing herpes simplex encephalitis; the most common cause of sporadic fatal viral encephalitis 19 . In the context of the current work we focused on the presumptive role of HSV-1 in the pathology of AD. A number of risk factors have been associated with AD, including the E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (Apo-E), diabetes, vascular pathology, neuroinflammation and infections 20 . Several recent studies have supported the theory of a significant role of HSV-1 in the disease 21 . HSV-1 DNA was found to be localized within amyloid plaques in AD patients and HSV-1 infection has been shown to promote neurotoxic Aβ accumulation in human neural cells and to the formation of Aβ deposits in the brains of infected mice 22,23 . Moreover, the presence of anti-HSV IgM antibodies, which indicate HSV reactivation, is correlated with a high risk of AD and antiherpetic treatment is correlated with a reduced risk of developing dementia 24,25 . Despite these correlations, the mechanism by which viruses induce amyloid aggregation, the major pathological hallmark of AD, is not known. In the present study, we demonstrated that upon encountering different biological fluids, RSV accumulated extensive and distinct protein coronae compared to HSV-1 and synthetic liposomes. The various coronae were dependent on the biological fluid and exerted markedly different effects on RSV infectivity and capacity to activate monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs). Moreover, upon interaction with an amyloidogenic peptide derived from IAPP, RSV accelerated the process of amyloid aggregation via surface-assisted heterogenous nucleation. This amyloid catalysis was also demonstrated for HSV-1 and the Aβ42 peptide in-vitro and in an AD animal model. Our findings highlight the importance of viral protein corona interactions for viral pathogenesis and provide a direct mechanistic link between viral and amyloid pathologies. Results Based on the extensive literature describing the significant role of corona factors in synthetic nanoparticle functionality, we used established techniques to answer questions regarding RSV pathogenicity 26 . Using proteomics, we assessed the RSV protein corona profiles in adult human plasma (HP), juvenile (6 months old infants tested RSV negative at the time of sample collection) human plasma (jHP), human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from healthy adults, rhesus macaque plasma (MP), and fetal bovine serum (FBS). These biological fluids represent different microenvironments encountered by the virus in terms of tissue tropism (HP vs. BALF), zoonosis (MP) and culturing conditions (FBS). The biological fluids were screened for antibodies against RSV using ELISA, and both adult HP and BALF contained high levels of anti-RSV IgG antibodies, unlike jHP, MP and FBS (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Viral stocks were produced in serum-free conditions to prevent initial contamination with FBS proteins. Virions produced under serum-free conditions were incubated with 10% v/v solutions of different biological fluids. Controls included non-infected cell medium representing the background cellular secretome, and synthetic lipid vesicles of a size comparable to RSV (200 nm) with positively or negatively charged surfaces. In addition, we compared the coronae of RSV to HSV-1 to probe for differences between different viruses of relatively similar size. After incubation for 1 h at 37 ˚C, the virions were re-harvested by centrifugation and washed twice before performing mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses. Six replicates from two independent experiments. Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7 software. The detection of specific anti-RSV IgG antibodies in biological fluids was performed using Human Anti-Respiratory syncytial virus IgG ELISA Kit (ab108765, abcam®, Sweden), according to manufacturer's protocol. All biological fluids (FBS, HP, MP, BALF) were diluted to a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml before performing the assay and results were compared to the positive, cutoff, and negative controls provided by the kit manufacturer. HEp-2 cells were seeded in maintenance medium until they reached 50-60% confluency. On the day of infection, the cells were washed twice with warm PBS and medium was changed to VP-SFM with gentamycin. Before adding to the cells, sucrose cushion-concentrated RSV stocks were pre-incubated with different biological fluids (FBS, HP, MP, BALF) at a final protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml in VP-SFM with 10 mM sodium citrate for 1 h at 37 ˚C. The corona-precoated viruses were then added to the cells in serum-free conditions (diluted 10x) at a MOI of 1. 24h post-infection, the medium was changed back to growth medium and cells were visualized with fluorescence microscopy 72h post-infection. After visualization, the cells were washed and stained with LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Far Red Dead Cell Stain Kit (ThermoFisher, USA) for 30 min at 4 ˚C in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS no calcium, no magnesium, ThermoFisher), then fixed and washed for flow cytometry using Cytofix/Cytoperm™ (BD, USA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then scraped and resuspended in DPBS, and the data was acquired using MACSQuant® Analyser 10 flowcytometer (Miltenyi Biotec, Sweden). The data was analyzed by FlowJo software (TreeStar) by excluding the dead cells stained with far-red fluorescent dye and subsequent calculation of GFP positive cells within the viable cell population. For experiments with palivizumab, cells were treated with different concentrations of the antibody before infection. Human monocytes were negatively selected from buffy coats using the RosetteSep Monocyte Enrichment Kit (1mL/10mL buffy coat; StemCell Technologies) and differentiated into moDC, using GM-CSF (250ng/mL; PeproTech) and IL-4 (6.5ng/mL; R&D Systems) for 6 days in 37°C, 5% CO2 at a density of 5x10 5 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 completed with 10% FCS, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 10mM HEPES, 2mM L-glutamine, and 1% and penicillin/streptomycin (ThermoFisher, USA). Immature moDC were exposed to RSV pre-incubated with different biological fluids for 4h in serum free media, washed and then incubated in serum containing medium for 72 h before analyses of CD86 and RSV-GFP expression. Dead cells were excluded using Live/Dead fixable near-IR dead cell stain kit (ThermoFisher). Flow cytometry sample data were acquired on a Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and the analysis was performed in FlowJo software (TreeStar).

Despite their undoubted importance, astroviruses still represent one of the least studied groups of human positive-sense RNA viruses. The genome contains three main open reading frames: ORF1a encoding a nonstructural polyprotein (nsP1a), ORF1b encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and ORF2 encoding the capsid protein (CP) (Fig. 1A) 3 . ORF1a and ORF1b are translated from the genomic RNA (gRNA), with expression of ORF1b depending on programmed ribosomal frameshifting whereby a proportion of ribosomes translating ORF1a make a −1 nucleotide shift into ORF1b. Frameshifting occurs at a conserved A_AAA_AAC sequence within the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap region and depends on a 3′-adjacent stimulatory RNA stem-loop structure 4 . ORF2 is translated from a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) that is produced during virus infection. Previously, using comparative genomics we identified a conserved fourth ORF (ORFX) in genogroup I astroviruses, which appears to be subject to purifying selection and therefore is likely to encode a functional protein product, termed the X protein (XP, 12 kDa, 112 aa) 5 . ORFX overlaps the 5′ region of the capsid-encoding ORF2 and is predicted to be translatable via ribosomal leaky scanning, which is expected to be enhanced by the very short leader on the sgRNA 3,6,7 . However, despite the comparative genomic predictions, the existence, relevance, and function of XP have never been demonstrated. Here we perform a functional molecular dissection of ORFX, providing insight into the simultaneous orchestration of several overlapping functional elements in a small human-pathogenic RNA virus. We show that ORFX is translated during virus infection, XP knockout mutant viruses are highly attenuated, and XP is a transmembrane (TM) protein that promotes efficient virus release via a viroporin-like activity. Through an extended bioinformatic analysis, we predict that related XP proteins are widely encoded in other mammalian astroviruses including the divergent "MLB" group of human-infecting astroviruses. Comparative genomic analysis reveals a potential ORFX in genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses. Since there are many more astrovirus sequences available now than in 2010, we began by repeating our previous comparative genomic analysis but this time also extending to other astrovirus genogroups. All mammalian astrovirus complete or nearly complete genome sequences were obtained from the	-9.125067710876465	29.2491455078125
Long-read sequencing technologies are invaluable for determining complex RNA transcript architectures but are error-prone. Numerous "hybrid correction" algorithms have been developed for genomic data that correct long reads by exploiting the accuracy and depth of short reads sequenced from the same sample. These algorithms are not suited for correcting more complex transcriptome sequencing data. We have created a novel algorithm called TALC (Transcription Aware Long Read Correction) which models changes in RNA expression and isoform representation in a weighted De-Bruijn graph to correct long reads from transcriptome studies. We show that transcription aware correction by TALC improves the accuracy of the whole spectrum of downstream RNA-seq applications and is thus necessary for transcriptome analyses that use long read technology.	14.934168815612793	11.09807014465332
Many mammalian carnivore species have been reduced to small, isolated populations by habitat destruction, fragmentation, poaching, and human conflict. Their limited genetic variability and increased exposure to domestic animals such as dogs place them at risk of further losses from infectious diseases. In India, domestic and feral dogs are associated with villages in and around protected areas, and may serve as reservoirs of pathogens to the carnivores within. India's Kanha Tiger Reserve (KTR) is home to a number of threatened and endangered mammalian carnivores including tiger (Panthera tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), wolf (Canis lupus), and dhole (Cuon alpinus). It also has more than 150 villages with associated dog populations. We found that dog populations ranged from 14 to 45/village (3.7 to 23.7/km 2 ), and did not vary with village area, human population size, or distance from the KTR's core area, though they all increased between summer 2014 and winter 2015, primarily through reproduction. No dog tested positive for rabies but seroprevalence levels to three other generalist viral pathogens were high in summer (N=67) and decreased somewhat by winter (N=168): canine parvovirus (83.6% to 68.4%), canine distemper virus (50.7% to 30.4%) and canine adenovirus (41.8% to 30.9%). The declines in seroprevalence were primarily due to new recruitments by birth and these were not yet exposed to the viruses. Wild carnivores frequently entered the villages, as shown by tracks, scats, kills and other indicators, and the dogs are known to leave the villages so that encounters between dogs and wild carnivores may be common. We conclude that there is a large population of unvaccinated dogs in and around Kanha Tiger Reserve, with high levels of seroprevalence to pathogens with broad host ranges and these dogs which interact with wild carnivores, therefore posing a high risk of disease spillover to the wild carnivores.	6.295861721038818	-12.35487174987793
Many pathogens take advantage of the dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate to regulate homeostasis and use heparan sulfate as a means to adhere and gain access to cells. Moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulfated. Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulfate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) and heparin. The data demonstrate an interaction between the recombinant surface receptor binding domain and the polysaccharide. This has implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antivirals.	-22.83758544921875	30.75425910949707

Nipah Virus (NiV) came into limelight recently due to an outbreak in Kerala, India. NiV causes severe disease and death in people with over 75% case fatality rate. It is a public health concern and has the potential to become a global pandemic. Lack of treatment has forced the containment methods to be restricted to isolation and surveillance. WHO's 'R&D Blueprint list of priority diseases' (2018) indicates that there is an urgent need for accelerated research & development for addressing NiV. In the quest for druglike NiV inhibitors (NVIs) a thorough literature search followed by systematic data curation was conducted. Rigorous data analysis was done with curated NVIs for prioritizing druglike compounds. For the same, more than 1800 descriptors of NVIs were computed and comparative analysis was performed with the FDA approved small molecules and antivirals. These compounds were further evaluated through PAINS filter to study their toxicity profile. Simultaneously, compounds were also prioritized based on the robustness of the assays through which they were identified. Our efforts lead to the creation of a well-curated structured knowledgebase of 182 NVIs with 98 small molecule inhibitors. The reported IC50/EC50 values for some of these inhibitors are in the nanomolar range -as low as 0.47 nM. In order to prioritize these inhibitors, we performed several tests and applied filters to identify drug-like non-toxic compounds. Of 98, a few compounds passed DruLito & PAINS filters exhibiting drug-like properties and were also prioritized in an independent screen based only the assay robustness. The NVIs have diverse structural features and offer a wide spectrum of ways in which they can be developed further as druglike molecules. We report a knowledgebase for furthering the development of NVIs. The platform has a diverse set of 98 NVIs of which a few have been prioritized based on a combined evidence strategy. The platform has the provision to submit new inhibitors as and when reported by the community for further enhancement of NiV inhibitor landscape.	13.027305603027344	1.8084930181503296
Objective: This paper studied the relationship between personality traits and mental health conditions of medical personnel to provide a basis and reference for the implementation of targeted education on mental health. A self-report inventory, the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), was used to investigate the mental health status of 548 medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus pneumonia in eight provinces and cities of China. The overall mean SCL-90 score and mean values of factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of the medical personnel were significantly higher than in the norm group (p < 0.05), while their average interpersonal sensitivity score was significantly lower (p < 0.01). In addition, personal factors affecting the mental health status of medical personnel were identified. ( all p < 0.05). The overall mental health status of medical personnel responding to new coronavirus pneumonia is generally higher than that of the norm group in China. The results of this study should contribute to measures to alleviate the psychological pressures on medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus epidemic in China.

Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is a powerful tool to understand and control plant metabolic pathways, which is central to plant biotechnology. PTGS is commonly accomplished through delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cells. Standard plant siRNA delivery methods (Agrobacterium and viruses) involve coding siRNA into DNA vectors, and are only tractable for certain plant species. Herein, we develop a nanotube-based platform for direct delivery of siRNA, and show high silencing efficiency in intact plant cells. We demonstrate that nanotubes successfully deliver siRNA and silence endogenous genes owing to effective intracellular delivery and nanotubeinduced protection of siRNA from nuclease degradation. This study establishes that nanotubes could enable a myriad of plant biotechnology applications that rely on RNA delivery to intact cells.	-2.6754164695739746	51.60669708251953
Public health concerns about recent viral epidemics have motivated researchers to seek transdisciplinary understanding of infection in wildlife hosts. With its deep history devoted to explaining the abundance and distribution of organisms, ecology can augment current methods for studying viral dynamics. However, datasets allowing ecological explorations of viral communities are lacking, and common methods for delineating viral operational taxonomic units (OTUs), or "species", are subjective. Here, we comprehensively sampled 1,086 bats from two Puerto Rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses. Using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm, we categorized herpesviruses into 41 OTUs, representing approximately 80% of all herpesviruses in the host community. Although 13 OTUs were detected in multiple host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined. Only two OTUs showed significantly different prevalence between host sexes. This work is the first exploration of viral community ecology in a community of wildlife hosts.

Recently emerged Wuhan's novel coronavirus designated as SARS-CoV-2, a causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading its pathogenicity throughout the world now. More than 4000 mortalities have occurred worldwide till the writing of this article and this number is increasing every passing hour. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it as a global public health emergency. The multiple sequence alignment data correlated with already published reports on SARS-CoV-2 indicated that it is closely related to Bat-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome like coronavirus (Bat CoV SARS-like) and wellstudied Human SARS. In this study, we have exploited the complementary approach to examine the intrinsically disordered regions in proteome of SARS-CoV-2 using Bat SARSlike and Human SARS CoVs as comparative models. According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains a significant amount of ordered proteins except Nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and ORF6. Further, cleavage sites in replicase 1ab polyprotein are found to be highly disordered. We have extensively investigated the dark proteome in SARS-CoV-2 which will have implications for the structured and unstructured biology of SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses. Significance: The infection caused by Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current pandemic that cause severe respiratory disease and pneumonia-like infection in humans. Currently, there is no such in-depth information on protein structure and function available in public domain and no effective anti-viral or vaccines are available for the treatment of this infection. Our study provides comparative order and disorder-based proteome information with Human SARS and Bat CoV that may be useful for structure-based drug discovery.	-20.162586212158203	11.749777793884277
Reproductive success in the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) was measured using a diallel-mating scheme. Over a 48-month period we generated 4,448 litters, and 24,782 weaned pups were used across 16 different published experiments. We identified factors that affect the average litter size in a cross by estimating the overall contribution of parent-of-origin, heterosis, inbred, and epistatic effects using a Bayesian zero-truncated overdispersed Poisson mixed model. The phenotypic variance of litter size has a substantial contribution (79%) from unexplained and environmental sources, but no detectable effect of seasonality. Most of the explained variance was due to additive effects (9.2%) and parental sex (maternal vs paternal strain; 5.8%), with epistasis accounting for 3.4%. Within the parental effects, the effect of the dam's strain explained more than the sire's strain (13.2% vs. 1.8%), and the dam's strain effects account for 74.2% of total variation explained. Dams from strains C57BL/6J and NOD/ShiLtJ increased the expected litter size by a mean of 1.66 and 1.79 pups, whereas dams from strains WSB/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and CAST/EiJ reduced expected litter size by a mean of 1.51, 0.81, and 0.90 pups. Finally, there was no strong evidence for strain-specific effects on sex ratio distortion. Overall, these results demonstrate that strains vary substantially in their reproductive ability depending on their genetic background and that litter size is largely determined by dam.strain rather than sire.strain effects, as expected. This analysis adds to our understanding of factors that influence litter size in mammals, and also helps to explain breeding successes and failures in the extinct lines and surviving CC strains.

School closure is often considered as an option to mitigate influenza epidemics because of its potential to reduce transmission in children and then in the community. The policy is still however highly debated because of controversial evidence. Moreover, the specific mechanisms leading to mitigation are not clearly identified.

Sialic acids (Sia) are the primary receptors for influenza viruses, and are widely displayed on cell surfaces and in secreted mucus. Sia may be present in variant forms that include O-acetyl modifications at C4, C7, C8, and C9 positions, and N-acetyl or N-glycolyl at C5. They can also vary in their linkages, including α2-3 or α2-6-linkages. Here, we analyzed the distribution of modified Sia in cells and tissues of wild-type mice, or in mice lacking cytidine 5'-30 monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) enzyme that synthesizes Nglycolyl modifications (Neu5Gc). We also examined the variation of Sia forms on erythrocytes and saliva from different animals. To determine the effect of Sia modifications on influenza A virus (IAV) infection, we tested for effects on hemagglutinin (HA) binding and neuraminidase (NA) cleavage. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl, 7,9-O-acetyl, 4-O-acetyl, and Neu5Gc 35 modifications are widely but variably expressed in mouse tissues, with the highest levels detected in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Secreted mucins in saliva and surface proteins of erythrocytes showed a great degree of variability in display of modified Sia between different species. IAV HA from different virus strains showed consistently reduced binding to both Neu5Gc and O-acetyl modified Sia; however, while IAV NA were inhibited by Neu5Gc and 40 O-acetyl modifications, there was significant variability between NA types. The modifications of Sia in mucus may therefore have potent effects on the functions of IAV, and may affect both pathogens and the normal flora of different mucosal sites. (241 words) IMPORTANCE 45 Sialic acids (Sia) are involved in many different cellular functions and are receptors for many pathogens. Sia come in many chemically modified forms but we lack a clear understanding of how they alter the interactions with microbes. Here we examine the expression of modified Sia in mouse tissues, on secreted mucus in saliva, and on erythrocytes, including those from IAV host species and animals used in IAV research. These Sia forms varied considerably between	-25.877044677734375	44.45101547241211
Since COVID-19 emerged in early December, 2019 in Wuhan and swept across China Mainland, a series of large-scale public health interventions, especially Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the "seed cases" from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054×x1+2.3455×x2 (n = 44, R 2 = 0.9330, P<10 -7 ). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% -48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of Wuhan and experience from China. Efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against COVID-19 were also assessed preliminarily according to the interpretive model. Big data has played and will continue playing an important role in public health.	6.242757797241211	-41.206356048583984

Since December 2019, more than 79,000 people have been diagnosed with infection of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 . A large number of medical staff were dispersed for Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083). However, the study found lower scores for VT in nurses [median = 69; interquartile range (IQR) = 56-85] than those of the GP (median = 75.5; IQR = 62-88.3) (P = 0.017). In addition, the VT scores for front-line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52-75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (nFLNs; median = 75.5; IQR = 63-92) (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the VT scores of the GP were significantly higher than those of the FLNs (P < 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed compared with those of nFLNs (P > 0.05). Importantly, nFLNs are more likely to suffer from VT, which might be related to two factors, namely, gender [odds ratio (OR) = 3.1717; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.247-18.808; P = 0.002] and fertility [OR = 2.072; 95%CI = 0.626-24.533; P = 0.039]. Therefore, increased attention should be paid to the psychological problems of the medical staff, especially nFLNs, and GP under the situation of the spread and control of COVID-19.

Sodium-bile acid cotransporter, also denominated sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is an integral membrane protein with multiple hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The third extracellular domain of NTCP presents a stretch of nine aminoacids (KGIVISLVL) that is characterized by pronounced hydrophobicity and serves as receptor for a protein, preS1, showing the hydrophobic epta-peptide sequence NPLGFFP. Vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) is a multifunctional protein that is characterized by two hydrophobic regions able to bind fatty acids and vitamin D, respectively. Here we demonstrate that NTCP and DBP-MAF show significant sequence similarities as far as hydrophobic stretches of aminoacids are concerned. Alignment of the sequence of seven aminoacids preceding the 157-KGIVISLVL-165 stretch of NTCP shows four aminoacids that are identical to those of the corresponding sequence of DBP-MAF, and two that are conserved substitutions. In addition, in the sequence of DBP-MAF that is aligned with the sequence YKGIVISLVL of NTCP, there are two contiguous negatively charged aminoacids (ED) and, in the preceding epta-peptide sequence, there are three negatively charged aminoacids (D-ED), whereas in the corresponding sequence of NTCP there are only two (D--D) that are not contiguous. This concentration of negatively charged aminoacids may be involved in binding of protein inserts characterized by high density of positively charges residues. The alternating hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions described in this paper may help elucidating the biological roles of these proteins as far as protein-protein interactions are concerned.	-30.617380142211914	35.80586242675781
Summary Statement: DUX4 is thought to mediate cytopathology through p53. Here, DUX4 is shown to kill primary myoblasts and promote pathological phenotypes in the iDUX4[2.7] mouse model on the p53-null background, calling into question this notion. FSHD is a genetically dominant myopathy caused by mutations that cause expression of the normally silent DUX4 gene. This transcription factor has been shown to interfere with myogenesis when misexpressed at very low levels in myoblasts, and to cause cell death when overexpressed at high levels. A previous report using adeno-associated virus to deliver high levels of DUX4 to mouse skeletal muscle demonstrated severe pathology that was suppressed on a p53 knockout background, implying that DUX4 acted through the p53 pathway. Here, we investigate the p53-dependence of DUX4 using both in vitro cellular and the transgenic iDUX4[2.7] mouse models. We find that inhibiting p53 has no effect on the cytoxicity of DUX4 in vitro. When crossed onto the p53 null background, we find no suppression of the male-specific lethality or skin phenotypes of the DUX4 transgene, and find that primary myoblasts from this mouse are still killed by DUX4 expression. These data challenge the notion that the p53 pathway is central to the pathogenicity of DUX4. 166 words.	7.4886603355407715	44.972347259521484
The COVID-19 disease has plagued over 110 countries and has resulted in over 4,000 deaths within 10 weeks. We compare the interaction between the human ACE2 receptor and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with that of other pathogenic coronaviruses using molecular dynamics simulations. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63 recognize ACE2 as the natural receptor but present a distinct binding interface to ACE2 and a different network of residue-residue contacts. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have comparable binding affinities achieved by balancing energetics and dynamics. The SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to SARS-CoV. These findings expose an exceptional evolutionary exploration exerted by coronaviruses toward host recognition. We postulate that the versatility of cell receptor binding strategies has immediate implications on therapeutic strategies. One Sentence Summary: Molecular dynamics simulations reveal a temporal dimension of coronaviruses interactions with the host receptor.	-25.70928192138672	23.104089736938477
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection outbreak a global health emergency. Currently, there is no effective anti-2019-nCoV medication. The sequence identity of the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS is 96%, which provides a sound foundation for structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Based on a SARS 3CL protease X-ray crystal structure, we construct a 3D homology structure of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease. Based on this structure and existing experimental datasets for SARS 3CL protease inhibitors, we develop an SBDR model based on machine learning and mathematics to screen 1465 drugs in the DrugBank that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We found that many FDA approved drugs are potentially highly potent to 2019-nCoV.	-30.37209701538086	6.953249931335449
The ability to detect an infectious agent in a widespread epidemic is crucial to the success of quarantine efforts in addition to sensitive and accurate screening of potential cases of infection from patients in a clinical setting. Enabling testing outside of sophisticated laboratories broadens the scope of control and surveillance efforts, but also requires robust and simple methods that can be used without expensive instrumentation. Here we report a method to identify SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus RNA from purified RNA or cell lysis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using a visual, colorimetric detection. This test was additionally verified using RNA samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China with equivalent performance to a commercial RT-qPCR test while requiring only heating and visual inspection. This simple and sensitive method provides an opportunity to facilitate virus detection in the field without a requirement for complex diagnostic infrastructure.

The basic reproductive number -R 0 -is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Nevertheless, estimating R 0 for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same R 0 . Here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of R 0 and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. To facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (R 0 ) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-nCoV, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-nCoV from 5-40% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R 0 when predicting epidemic size.	21.790294647216797	-12.764429092407227
The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. : bioRxiv preprint B cell responses in recovered patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: A six-year follow-up study.	-15.01751708984375	11.05029582977295

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/639369 doi: bioRxiv preprint Up to recently, four viral families, Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, Roniviridae, and Mesoniviridae constituted the Nidovirales order. The Coronaviridae family was further divided in two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. The Torovirinae family contained two genus Torovirus and Bafinivirus, plus few unassigned species. Recently, the ICTV proposed a novel classification into the Nidovirales order, with the creation of nine families [1] . In this novel ICTV proposal, ratified on February 2019, Coronaviridae do not encompass both Coronavirinae and Toronavirinae subfamilies. Rather, the new suborder Tornidovirinae (including toroviruses and bafiniviruses) contains a novel family, Tobaniviridae, at the same level as the Coronaviridae, which is now within suborder Cornidovirineae. This new taxonomy is used here, as depicted in Fig. 1 . Nidovirales have attracted much attention in the past decades for being causative agents of serious diseases in humans and animals. In humans, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) have been associated with high fatality/case ratios of ∼10% and ∼35 %, respectively (reviewed in [2]). In animals, pathogens of significant economical and societal impact include Equine Arteritis virus (EAV, Alphaarterivirus equid) and Porcine Reproductive Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRSSV 1-2, Betaarterivirus suid 1-2). Two salient features of these viruses are, amongst others, their complex and still obscure replication/transcription mechanism as well as their broad genome-size range. Genomes of Arteriviridae (12.7 -15.7 kb in length), Mesoniviridae (∼20 kb), Medioniviridae (20.2 -25 kb), Euroniviridae (∼24.5 kb), Roniviridae (∼26 kb) Tobaniviridae and Coronaviridae (∼27-32 kb), Abyssoviridae (35.9 kb), and Mononiviridae (41.1 kb) members, share a similar genomic organisation generating viral mRNAs from a fixed genomic location, the 'nest', which has inspired the family name (Nido : latin for 'nest') [3, 4] . Nidovirales genomic and mRNAs are presumably capped, although direct demonstration of the presence of an RNA cap structure is still missing for many of these Nidovirales members. In Eukaryotes, the RNA cap structure is thought to be synthesized post-transcriptionally [5] . Most of (+)RNA viruses supposedly follow a conventional RNA capping pathway [6] in which nascent viral 5'-triphosphate genomic (or mRNAs) is thought to be processed through three enzymatic reactions to yield an RNA cap whose structure is indistinguishable from that of cellular mRNAs. The capping pathway implies that the 5'-triphosphate RNA is hydrolyzed into 5'-diphosphate by an RNA triphosphatase, a GMP residue (the « cap », coming from GTP) is next covalently transferred to the 5'-diphosphate RNA in the 5' to 5' orientation by a guanlylyltransferase (GTase), releasing inorganic pyrophosphate. Both the cap and the first transcribed nucleotide are then methylated at the N7-guanine (mGpppN-RNA, so-called Cap0 structure) and the 2'-oxygen position (mGpppNm-RNA, Cap1 structure) by one or two RNA methyltransferases (MTases), respectively. The MTase uses S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor and releases S-Adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH). There is no high-resolution structural analysis available of Nidovirales RNA caps. The evidence for their presence comes from immunological detection in Torovirus genomic and mRNAs [7] , and co-migration analysis in low-resolution chromatographic techniques for MHV [8] and Simian Hemorragic fever virus [9] . In other instances, Nidovirales cap structures supposedly conform to the canonical eukaryotic RNA capping pathway because enzymes usually deemed necessary to perform RNA capping are present in cognate genomes (reviewed in [6]). Bioinformatic analyses have been used to detect signature-sequences typically associated with RNA capping/modifying enzymes i.e guanlylyltransferase (GTase), polymerase, helicase, nuclease, and methyltransferase (MTase). These signature-sequences have served in many instances to isolate corresponding enzymes endowed with the predicted activity.	-9.97704792022705	24.33803939819336
The cutting-edge technology vaccinomics is the combination of two topics immunogenetics and immunogenomics with the knowledge of systems biology and immune profiling for designing vaccine against infectious disease. In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC 50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores -725.0 Kcal/mole and -786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also. Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as potential peptides for peptide-based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study.	-33.743045806884766	30.414161682128906
The mechanisms underlying multicellular development in the animal stem lineage may 25 be reconstructed through the study of choanoflagellates, the closest living relatives of 26 animals. To determine the genetic underpinnings of multicellularity in the emerging 27 model choanoflagellate S. rosetta, we performed a screen for mutants with defects in 28 multicellular rosette development. In two of the mutants, Jumble and Couscous, single 29 cells failed to develop into orderly rosettes but instead aggregated promiscuously into 30 amorphous clumps of cells. Both mutants mapped to lesions in genes encoding 31 glycosyltransferases and the mutations perturbed glycosylation patterns in the 32 extracellular matrix (ECM). In animals, glycosyltransferases transfer activated sugars to 33 donor molecules and thereby sculpt the polysaccharide-rich ECM, regulate integrin and 34 cadherin activity, and, when disrupted, contribute to tumorigenesis. The finding that 35 glycosyltransferases promote proper rosette development and prevent cell aggregation 36 in S. rosetta suggests a pre-metazoan role for glycosyltransferases in regulating 37 development and preventing abnormal tumor-like multicellularity.	-0.43076130747795105	43.445438385009766
The ongoing Zika epidemic in the Americas has challenged public health surveillance, response, and control systems. Even as the epidemic appears to be near its end in the Americas, it is unclear whether substantial Zika virus transmission may still be ongoing. This issue is exacerbated by large discrepancies in local case reporting and significant delays in detecting outbreaks due to surveillance gaps. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks in the Americas, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases diagnosed in the United States and Europe to identify signatures of transmission dynamics that were not captured by local reporting. We found that a large and unreported Zika outbreak occurred in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring countries, with cases still appearing in 2018. By sequencing Zika virus from infected travelers, we show that the 2017 outbreak in Cuba was sparked by longlived lineages of Zika virus introduced from multiple places in the Americas a year prior. Our data suggest that while aggressive mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, in the absence of vaccines, herd immunity, or strong international coordination, such control measures may need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be 'silently' spreading in the Americas and provides a framework for more accurately understanding outbreak dynamics.	5.551812648773193	-23.077722549438477

We examined the effects of 19 population outflow from Wuhan on the 2019-nCoV transmission in other provinces 20 and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan. We observed 21 a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of 22 cases. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two 23 days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could be prevented, and if two days 24 later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. Our findings suggest 25 that population movement might be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection 26 transmission in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to prevent the 27 epidemic.	1.0222210884094238	-42.54145812988281
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, originating from Wuhan, China in early December, has infected more than 70,000 people in China and other countries and has caused more than 2,000 deaths. As the disease continues to spread, the biomedical society urgently began identifying effective approaches to prevent further outbreaks. Through rigorous epidemiological analysis, we characterized the fast transmission of COVID-19 with a basic reproductive number 5.6 and proved a sole zoonotic source to originate in Wuhan. No changes in transmission have been noted across generations. By evaluating different control strategies through predictive modeling and Monte carlo simulations, a comprehensive quarantine in hospitals and quarantine stations has been found to be the most effective approach. Government action to immediately enforce this quarantine is highly recommended.	4.318385601043701	-34.99165344238281
The potential infectiousness of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases together with a substantial fraction of asymptomatic infections among all infections, have been highlighted in clinical studies. We conducted statistical modeling analysis to derive the delay-adjusted asymptomatic proportion of the positive COVID-19 infections onboard the Princess Cruises ship along with the timeline of infections. We estimated the asymptomatic proportion at 17.9% (95% CrI: 15.5%-20.2%), with most of the infections occurring before the start of the 2-week quarantine.

The recent outbreak of infections by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the third 36 zoonotic CoV has raised great public health concern. The demand for rapid and accurate 37 diagnosis of this novel pathogen brought significant clinical and technological challenges. 38 Currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and reverse-transcription PCR 39 (RT-PCR) are the most widely used molecular diagnostics for 2019-nCoV. 40 Methods 41 2019-nCoV infections were confirmed in 52 specimens by mNGS. Genomic information was 42 analyzed and used for the design and development of an isothermal, CRISPR-based 43 diagnostic for the novel virus. The diagnostic performance of CRISPR-nCoV was assessed 44 and also compared across three technology platforms (mNGS, RT-PCR and CRISPR) 45 Results 46 2019-nCoVs sequenced in our study were conserved with the Wuhan strain, and shared 47 certain genetic similarity with SARS-CoV.

The rigidity and flexibility of two recently reported crystal structures (PDB entries 6Y2E and 6LU7) of a protease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the infectious agent of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, has been investigated using pebble-game rigidity analysis, elastic network model normal mode analysis, and all-atom geometric simulations. This computational investigation of the viral protease follows protocols that have been effective in studying other homodimeric enzymes. The protease is predicted to display flexible motions in vivo which directly affect the geometry of a known inhibitor binding site and which open new potential binding sites elsewhere in the structure. A database of generated PDB files representing natural flexible variations on the crystal structures has been produced and made available for download from an institutional data archive. This information may inform structure-based drug design and fragment screening efforts aimed at identifying specific antiviral therapies for the treatment of COVID-19. Recent studies has established that the motions explored by geometric simulation correspond well to the essential dynamics extracted from MD trajectories [4] ; that global flexible motions can couple to .	-32.30403518676758	21.32465171813965
The spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a global emergency, that demands urgent solutions for detection and therapy to prevent escalating health, social and economic impacts. The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells 1 . The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar 2 , but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3 . Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 4-6 , the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection 7,8 . However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride 9,10 ) or the PBM (SB203580 5 ), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.	-16.442670822143555	17.14039421081543
The use of metabolomics profiling to understand metabolism under different 20 physiological states has increased in recent years, which created the need for robust analytical 21 platforms. Here, we present a validated method for targeted and semi-quantitative analysis of 102 22 polar metabolites that covers major metabolic pathways from 24 classes in a single 17.5-min assay. The method has been optimized for a wide range of biological matrices from various organisms, 24 and involves automated sample preparation, and data processing using in-house developed R 25 package. To ensure reliability, the method was validated for accuracy, precision, selectivity, 26 specificity, linearity, recovery, and stability according to European Medicines Agency guidelines. We demonstrated excellent repeatability of the retention times (CV<4%), calibration curves 28 (R 2 ≥0.980) in their respective wide dynamic concentration ranges (CV<3%), and concentrations 29 (CV<25%) of quality control samples interspersed within 25 batches analyzed over a period of one- year. The robustness was demonstrated through high correlation between metabolite 31 concentrations measured using our method and NIST reference values (R 2 =0.967), including cross-32 platform comparability against the BIOCRATES AbsoluteIDQp180 kit (R 2 =0.975) and NMR analyses 33 (R 2 =0.884). We have shown that our method can be successfully applied in many biomedical 34 research fields and clinical trials, including epidemiological studies for biomarker discovery. In 35 summary, a thorough validation demonstrated that our method is reproducible, robust, reliable, 36 and suitable for metabolomics studies.	18.439237594604492	18.83771514892578
Two months after it was firstly reported, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has already spread worldwide. However, the vast majority of reported infections have occurred in China. To assess the effect of early travel restrictions adopted by the health authorities in China, we have implemented an epidemic metapopulation model that is fed with mobility data corresponding to 2019 and 2020. This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. The latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions. Our study also highlights the importance of developing more realistic models of behavioral changes when a disease outbreak is unfolding.	16.162776947021484	-29.752971649169922
Viruses interact with hundreds to thousands of proteins in mammals, yet adaptation 6 against viruses has only been studied in a few proteins specialized in antiviral defense. Whether adaptation to viruses typically involves only specialized antiviral proteins or 8 affects a broad array of proteins is unknown. Here, we analyze adaptation in ~1,300 9 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9,900 proteins conserved 10 across mammals. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained 11 proteins from the cellular functions they hijack and that (ii) despite this high constraint, 12 virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in 13 humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across 14 all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions. Our results 15 demonstrate that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change 16 across mammalian and human proteomes.	-4.644965171813965	36.08852767944336
We developed a computational tool to assess the risks of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside of China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; and (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number R loc ). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high R loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low R loc benefit the most from policies that further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia, and Europe. We investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.	24.976747512817383	-36.078857421875
We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% & 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. Results: Under baseline assumptions exit and entry screening combined with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by at least 83 (75% of simulations: at least 36, 97.5% 8) days while there is no more than 1 infected traveller per week. The benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by at least 76 (75%: 33, 97.5%: 7) days. With increasing rates of infected travellers, less effective sensitisation or without screening these delays shrink rapidly to a week or less. Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination could delay outbreaks in yet unaffected countries and support local containment efforts, but only if infected traveller numbers are very low.

We report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and modelled COVID-19 infectiousness profile from a separate sample of 77 infector-infectee transmission pairs. We observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset, and inferred that infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset. We estimated that 44% of transmission could occur before first symptoms of the index. Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial pre-symptomatic transmission.	-7.248953819274902	-28.623367309570312
While the ecology of infectious disease is a rich field with decades worth of empirical evidence and theory, there are aspects that remain relatively under-examined. One example is the importance of the free-living survival stage of certain pathogens, and especially is cases where they are transmitted indirectly between hosts through an environmental reservoir intermediate. In this study, we develop an integrated, broadly applicable mathematical method to examine diseases fitting this description-the waterborne, abiotic and other indirectly transmitted (W.A.I.T.) infection framework. To demonstrate its utility, we construct realistic models of two very different epidemic scenarios: cholera in a densely populated setting with limited access to clean drinking water and hepatitis C virus in an urban setting of injection-drug users. Using these two exemplars, we find that the W.A.I.T. model fortifies the centrality of reservoir dynamics in the "sit and wait" infection strategy, and provides a way to simulate a diverse set of intervention strategies.	19.088207244873047	-18.308887481689453
With the emergence of 4 rd generation transmission, the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 has entered a new period. We aimed to report several changes in the clinical characteristics at admission of patients with COVID-19. Clinical records and laboratory results of patients suffering from COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed and matched with the admission dates to analyze the changes in characteristics at the onset of illness. Of the 89 affected patients, 31 [34.8%] patients were admitted from January 16 to 22, and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from January 23 to 29. Patients were admitted with more systemic symptoms, such as fever (21 [67.7%] of 31), fatigue (13 [41.9%] of 31), and myalgia (7 [22.6%] of 31), before January 23. More patients (10 [32.3%] of 31) admitted before January 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared with a smaller proportion (4 [6.9%] of 58) of the patients admitted after January 23. Other symptoms, such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness, were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the group admitted before January 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 [54.2%] of 24), CD3 (11 [54.4%] of 21), and CD8 (9 [42.9%] of 21) counts and elevated serum amyloid A (SAA, 18 [75%] of 24). The initial symptoms of recently infected patients seem more insidious, indicating that the new coronavirus may gradually evolve into a virus similar to influenza and latent in asymptomatic carriers for a long time.	-28.242441177368164	-31.241559982299805
With the ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 , infected patients within and beyond the epidemic area, Wuhan, China, showed different epidemiological and clinical characteristics. There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan. We conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum. : Of the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao. The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan (55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P<0.0001). The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%. Interpretation: We reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China. Precautions are needed when dealing with COVID-19 patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory pathogens. We highly recommend adding SARS-CoV-2 to routine diagnostic testing in capable hospitals to prevent misdetection of the virus.	-20.334739685058594	-35.252071380615234

Additionally, numerous next generation, syndromic surveillance systems; e.g., pharmacy sales 70 records [17, 18], Twitter conversations [19, 20], and Wikipedia hits [21, 22], have come online in the past five years. However, these systems cannot report the specific pathogen causing an increase in a particular set of symptoms.

https://doi.org/10.1101/326538 doi: bioRxiv preprint Existing evidence suggests that MERS-CoV may be originated from bats. In particular, 49 Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4 spike protein was shown to utilize MERS-CoV receptor, human 50 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). To better understand the potential infectivities of MERS-CoV in 51 bats, we developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including Tylonycteris 52 pachypus and Rhinolophus sinicus (host of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4 and SARS-related-53 CoV respectively). MERS-CoV demonstrated much broader cellular tropism than SARS-CoV 54 and HCoV-229E, being able to infect five cell lines, including R. sinicus but not T. pachypus 55 cells. The close phylogenetic relationship between bat and human DPP4 genes supported the 56 ability of MERS-CoV to infect bat cells, while DPP4 expression appeared critical for MERS-57 CoV replication. However, overexpression of T. pachypus DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV 58 susceptibility in T. pachypus cells. The broad cellular tropism of MERS-CoV may reflect the 59 host diversity of MERS-CoV-related viruses and offers insights into its ancestral origin. 60 61	-19.199073791503906	4.506173133850098

https://doi.org/10.1101/634600 doi: bioRxiv preprint IBV types. As such, the development of a pan-IBV sequencing method to rapidly determine the genotype(s) in samples would aid in lineage typing and tracking of IBV genotypes circulating in poultry flocks. Recently, third generation sequencing technology has been used for detection of viral nucleotides and sequencing ultra-long DNA molecules. 34 The MinION Nanopore sequencer, a new DNA sequencing technology that allows for rapid, in-house, real-time technique detection and differentiation of IBV lineages, may be cost effective and useful in the field. 19 Ampliconbased sequencing has also been used to amplify specific regions of Newcastle disease 3,13 , infectious laryngotracheitis virus 39 Zika 34 , Ebola 35 and avian influenza viruses 46 , by simple RT-PCR and then sequencing on the MinION device. Real-time data analysis, the lack of significant start-up cost investment or maintenance expenses, simultaneous and sequential multiplexing unique to MinION, and the ability to sequence long DNA molecules so that primers are in conserved regions while the product contains the variable region are the features that make this technology highly feasible to be used for disease diagnostics. Accurate identification of IBV genotypes from samples, including detection of multiple isolates from a single sample, is crucial to respiratory disease diagnosis, selection of appropriate IBV vaccines, and epidemiologic studies. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to create a single, amplicon-based protocol to sequence IBV-S1 gene and develop a sequence analysis workflow to identify IBV isolates from clinical swab samples. This method provides a useful assay for IBV and a model for the development of future amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) based assays. A universal S1 primer set, 27 tailed with the MinION universal adapter sequence of 22 nucleotides (underlined, Table 2 ) to allow barcoding of amplicons, was used for targeted amplification of the IBV S1 gene for IBV. The PCR reaction mixture (Expand High Fidelity PCR system, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was composed of 10 µl of cDNA, 1 µl of 10 µM forward primer, 1 µl of 10 µM reverse primer, 2.5 µl of 10× Expand high fidelity buffer, 1 µl of Expand High Fidelity Enzyme Mix, and 1 µl of 10mM dNTPs, to a final volume to 25 µl with 9 µl of nuclease-free water. The following thermocycling conditions were used for amplicon synthesis: denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 minutes, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. See Table 2 for details about all three primer sets used in this study. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) for visual evaluation. Amplified DNA was purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) at 1.6:1 (volumetric bead:DNA) and quantified using the dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit on a Qubit® Fluorimeter 3.0. The amplicons obtained from the tailed S1 primer set were then used to prepare MinIONcompatible DNA libraries. Briefly, each of the amplicons were diluted to 0.5 nM and amplified using barcoding primers (1D PCR Barcoding Amplicon Kit, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, [ONT], UK) and LongAmp Taq 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) with the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min; 15 cycles of 95 °C for 15 seconds, 62 °C for 15 seconds, 65 °C for 80 seconds; and 65 °C for 80 seconds. The barcoded amplicons were bead purified (1:1.4; bead:solution), pooled (Run1; pool of 10 samples, Run2; pool of 5 samples) into a single  Centrifuge 24 , Kraken 50 , QIIME 5 and Mothur 37 have been used to identify and profile microbial species; however, the high error rate 20 of Nanopore reads translates to poor classification accuracy for many of these tools. Alternatively, de novo 3,26 or reference-based 18 assembly methods have been used in MinION and other deep sequencing platforms. Using a strategy similar to other unbiased laboratory tests (e.g., standard bacterial cultures), an approach was developed to maximize usage of reads (i.e., reads are not discarded based on pre-set length or abundance requirements, similar to how a single colony may be interpreted as a significant result). This approach uses read-based classification against a database containing an equal number of representative sequences per lineage to detect and classify the reads based on their lineage, before conducting read-based classification to the isolate level by using all available IBV sequences in a separate database. Finally, lineage-clustered isolate-level read assignments are interpreted by a veterinary diagnostician to result in reads available for consensus building. The use of a final consensus alignment helps to overcome the individual error rate of MinION sequencing. 3 Similarly, the absence of predetermined metrics used in de novo assembly allows for the informed decision as to how many consensus sequences to build, a bioinformatics problem when dealing with clinical cases that can contain more than one isolate (e.g., similar to how there is not a predetermined number of significant bacterial colonies). Confirmatory followup tests (e.g., RT-PCR) may be needed when dealing with low number of reads in clinical samples; however, future testing of this new technology will allow for creating standards for such confirmatory testing. Taken together, these results suggest the application of MinION-based AmpSeq, specifically for detecting IBV isolates from clinical samples within a few days, compared to several days to weeks and multiple diagnostic assays to culture and detect multiple IBV	10.113380432128906	15.87817096710205

Sia come in 21 a variety of chemically modified forms, including those with acetyl modifications at the 22 C7, C8, and C9 positions. Here, we analyzed the distribution and amounts of these 23 acetyl modifications in different human and canine cells. As Sia or their variant forms 24 are receptors for influenza A and influenza C viruses, we examined the effects of these 25 modifications on virus infections. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl and 7,9-O-acetyl 26 modified Sia are widely but variably expressed across cell lines from both humans and 27 canines. While they were expressed on the cell surface of canine MDCK cell lines, they 28 were located primarily within the Golgi compartment of human HEK-293 and A549 cells. 29 The O-acetyl modified Sia were expressed at low levels of 1-2% of total Sia in these cell 30 lines. We knocked out and over-expressed the sialate O-acetyltransferase gene 31 (CasD1), and knocked out the sialate O-acetylesterase gene (SIAE) using 32 CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Knocking out CasD1 removed 7,9-O-and 9-O-acetyl Sia 33 expression, confirming previous reports. However, over-expression of CasD1 and 34 knockout of SIAE gave only modest increases in 9-O-acetyl levels in cells and no 35 change in 7,9-O-acetyl levels, indicating that there are complex regulations of these 36 modifications. These modifications were essential for influenza C infection, but had no 37 obvious effect on influenza A infection.	-23.271699905395508	47.79401397705078
